# WebFX UI for Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man Arcade games

## About this project

Repository [Pac-Man games](https://github.com/armin-reichert/pacman-basic) contains a UI-agnostic
Java implementation of the classic Arcade games Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man. A JavaFX user interface for these games, with
2D and 3D play scenes, can be found [here](https://github.com/armin-reichert/pacman-javafx).

This repository contains a [WebFX](https://webfx.dev/) compatible, stripped-down version of the JavaFX user intefaces without 3D scenes. 
It can be run on all platforms supported by WebFX, especially inside a browser via the GWT implementation.

## How to use

The game can be started by opening the following URL(s) in a browser:
- [Pac-Man/Ms. Pac-Man](https://armin-reichert.github.io/webfx-pacman/) (new WebFX application)
- [Ms. Pac-Man](https://mspacman.webfx.dev) (will be updated soon)
- [Pac-Man](https://pacman.webfx.dev) (will be updated soon)

### Scene selection

From the start page and intro scence of either game, you can switch to the other game by pressing <kbd>V</kbd>. Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> or clicking the "Play!"
button displays the intro scene of the selected game variant.

To be able to play, you first have to "insert a coin" which is done either by pressing the key <kbd>5</kbd> or by clicking anywhere on the intro scene. After having added credit, the game can be started by pressing key <kbd>1</kbd> or by clicking anywhere with the mouse (or touching). (The used keys are derived from the [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/) Arcade emulator). To quit the play scene and return to the intro scene, press key <kbd>Q</kbd>.

- Credit scene: Click/tap anywhere to start the game and change to the play scene.
